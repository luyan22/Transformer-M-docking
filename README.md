## Overview

![arch](docs/arch.jpg)

Transformer-M is a versatile and effective molecular model that can take molecular data of 2D or 3D formats as input and generate meaningful semantic representations. Using the standard Transformer as the backbone architecture, Transformer-M develops two separated channels to encode 2D and 3D structural information and incorporate them with the atom features in the network modules. When the input data is in a particular format, the corresponding channel will be activated, and the other will be disabled. Empirical results show that our Transformer-M can achieve strong performance on 2D and 3D tasks simultaneously, which is the first step toward general-purpose molecular models in chemistry.

## Results on PCQM4Mv2, OGB Large-Scale Challenge
